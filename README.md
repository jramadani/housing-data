# About this repository

This repository contains a project developed for DATA 78000 (Advanced Interactive Data Visualization Studio) at the CUNY Graduate Center, taught by Professor Aucher Serr.

## The Project: Affording the American Dream

This is a dashboard which seeks to give the user an overview of the housing market over a ten year range while also allowing them to drill down into the details by zip code as a springboard into understanding the shifts of American housing values. What does the landscape of typical home values look like in the United States? What does an affordable house look like, and how has it changed over the last decade?

Users can interact with the dashboard, toggling a switch for the start and end of the decade, entering different gross annual incomes, and clicking on, panning, and zooming on the map in order to dive into those details and explore how the landscape has changed from 2009 to 2019.

## About the code

The project was built using a mixture of d3.js, Mapbox GL JS, and some Bootstrap.
