# Design Notes

This project was built “mobile-first,” and will be receiving accessibility updates in the coming months in order to be useful to as many users as possible. What follows is a brief insight into the purely aesthetic design decisions made during the course of this project, as well as potential updates in the future.

## Color and Fonts

Fonts for the visualization were chosen in a standard serif/sans serif match, with the serif font chosen very specifically to invoke a sense of nostalgia in the user; the intent from a design perspective was to bring to mind the idea of the American Dream, and then, with the actual data, show the range of what is considered affordable.

When it came to choosing colors, I considered a wide variety of palettes, but strictly kept contrast in mind. I settled on the cool palette of blues and purples to evoke a calming sense in the user. It’s easy on the eyes, has a good value spread, and neutralizes the potentially alarming idea of the vast increase of single-family home price values over time.

## Mobile

The mobile version of Affording the American Dream was designed to be viewed on a single screen. I wanted a header that would stretch across the top, reminiscent of most successful web apps, as well as an informational panel above the map. I kept the map on the very bottom of the screen because I wanted the user to go through the description and primary inputs before getting to the map—most people read from top to bottom, so this seemed rather intuitive.

## Desktop

On desktop, there is much more room for the visualization to “stretch out,” as it were, so I allowed the map to take up half the screen, while the other half was all text and supplementary materials. In this way, I create a bit of aesthetic balance in the visualization. I didn’t want the header to stretch out all the way across the screen like the mobile version, so I gave it only half of the space, optimizing the usage of all of the space available on a larger screen. The slightly more gray area on the screen where the line graph and summary statistics populate was initially there as a concept in my high fidelity mock-ups because I wanted to signal that the area was waiting to be filled, and not just glaring emptiness. For a little while, I tabled the concept, mainly to experiment and see what else could be done with it, but I ended up going back to it because it felt right.
