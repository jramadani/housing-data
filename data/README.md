# Data and Methodology

This is an overview of the data contained in this folder and used to build the visualization.

### Zillow & the ZHVI

The main data used in this project is from [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/). It was specifically pulled from the section titled “Home Values,” and the dataset downloaded was “ZHVI Single-Family Homes Time Series ($)” with “ZIP Code” selected for Geography.

This data specifically uses what Zillow calls the ZHVI, or Zillow Home Value Index. According to Zillow, the ZHVI is a smoothed, seasonally adjusted measure of the typical home value and market changes across a given region and housing type. Their methodology splits the housing market into three tiers: bottom, middle, and top. This particular dataset is in the middle tier, and so reflects the typical value for homes in the 35th to 65th percentile range.

The ZHVI relies on something that Zillow calls a [Zestimate](https://www.zillow.com/zestimate/), generated via machine learning, which is an estimate of a home’s market value. Home values are usually generated by appraisal, but not all homes have been appraised; this is why Zillow uses machine learning models with the available data to generate estimates.

### Data Cleaning Methodology

In order to get the data into a form that was usable for my project, I used Python in Jupyter Labs in conjunction with NumPy and pandas. For the sake of cleanliness and reducing file size, I dropped several features that were irrelevant to the project (the corresponding neighborhood, the geographic type).

Because the data was in a time series—each month per year had its own column, stretching back from 1996 to mid-2020—I needed to pivot those columns to get individual price indices for each zip code per month/year. Next, I dropped all rows prior to 2009 and finally, took an average for each year per zip code in order to make the dataset lighter.

The features in the cleaned dataset are: county, price index, zip, state name, and year. After taking the subset of years 2009 to mid-2020, the final dataset in this repository contains 364,752 rows.
